# 🌸 Iris Classification Machine Learning Project

This project classifies the Iris dataset into three species—**Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**—using three popular machine learning models: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Decision Trees**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The **Iris dataset** consists of **150 samples** with **four features**:

- 🌱 Sepal Length  
- 🌱 Sepal Width  
- 🌺 Petal Length  
- 🌺 Petal Width  

🎯 The objective is to predict the species of an iris flower based on these features using classification models.
